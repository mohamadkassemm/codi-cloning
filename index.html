        <h5>Our mission is to use <span>coding and digital skills</span> to enable <span>inclusion and employment</span>, and as a catalyst for <span> social innovation and diversity</span>. We are a combination between a <span> coding bootcamp</span> and a <span> leadership course</span>, based in <span> Beirut</span> and now <span>Tripoli</span>. Our aim is to get marginalised youth to participate in the <span> growing needs of the local ICT and software sector</span>.</h5>

            <h3>Free School of Programming</h3>
            <p>Codi is a <span> free school of programming</span> for people who have a passion for digital and want to <span> build a career in technology</span> but cannot pursue a traditional university education.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>It is the <span> first training centre</span> to foster digital and technical skills for the youth in Lebanon. Our courses are <span> open to everyone</span> but primarily targeted to youth, who are not currently employed, with little academic background, and otherwise marginalised from society (incl. refugees).</p>
